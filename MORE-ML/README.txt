Workflow for applying the MORE-ML framework to binding feature prediction and explanation:

1. Load data files and convert into dataframes

2. Create input features

3. Delete outliers

4. Train/test set splitting via farthest point sampling (FPS)

5. Training and evaluating models using optimized hyperparameters

6. Explanation on trained model
