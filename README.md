# MORE-Q user guide

This github repository aims at providing user guide for the **Dataset for molecular olfactorial receptor engineering by quantum mechanics (MORE-Q)**

In this repository, one could find one jupyter-notebook file __MORE-Q_user_guide.ipynb__ and one python script __createDF.py__. 

__MORE-Q-user-guide__ contains step-by-step codes for data extraction from HDF5 files using __createDF.py__ and reproduction of the technical validation figures. 

One can download MORE-Q HDF5 files from ZENODO under: 10.5281/zenodo.13741197
